Summary:
In Paper Theories, books are more than just words on paper — they are doors to parallel worlds, hidden mysteries, and secret messages that writers left for us like clues. Here, we debate stories like detective cases, break down each page to find hidden meanings, and still have time for some wild conspiracy theories. What if that ending is not what it seems? What if the author knew more than they said?

If you love literature but also enjoy discussing whether the main character was a secret agent without knowing it, if that romance was really about love or just a power game, then this is the podcast for you. Join us and discover that, sometimes, reality is even stranger than fiction! 📚🔍
